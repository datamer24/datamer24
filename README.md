- 👋 Hi, I’m Meral, and I'm a shameless fan of Limericks and Haikus poems😄 and a passable avant-garde artist (recently added cyanotype and marble art methods to my repertoire)😄.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java, SQL🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Java, and SQL (perhaps, LaTeX, too :).
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just drop me a message!
- 😄 My fave subjects: STEM, languages and art...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I accidentally became a puzzle maker, and I've discovered scrambled eggs are cooked so well in a toast machine😄 The first time I started loving Python programming thanks to Stanford's awesome, amazing, incredible, Prof. Chris Piech and Prof. M. Sahami and the section teachers who deserve all the superlative positive adjectives in all of the languages I know. Their lecture notes were awesome! I still read them in my free time :) Yeah⚡
