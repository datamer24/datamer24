- 👋 Hi, I’m Meral, and I'm a shameless fan of Limericks and Haikus (well, those kinds of poems)😄 and a passable avant-garde artist (recently added cyanotype method to my list, too)😄.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java, SQL.🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Java, and SQL.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just go ahead and drop me a message!
- 😄 My fave subjects: chem, phys, bio, and art...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I accidentally became a puzzle maker by coding and I've discovered scrambled eggs are cooked so well in a toast machine (yes, I like experimenting)😄 😄
