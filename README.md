- 👋 Hi, I’m Meral, and I'm a shameless fan of Limericks and Haikus poems😄 and a passable avant-garde artist (recently added cyanotype and marble art methods to my repertoire)😄.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java, SQL🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Java, and SQL (perhaps, LaTeX, too :).
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just drop me a message!
- 😄 My fave subjects: STEM, languages and art...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I accidentally became a puzzle maker, and I've discovered scrambled eggs are cooked so well in a toast machine😄 ⚡
